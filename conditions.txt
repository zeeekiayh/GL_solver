This file contains the parameters for the solving method and the boundary
counditions. Each value must be directly after it's respective line that
begins with "#". All other text will be ignored.

#SIZE
   18 18
   the length, or number of points in each direction

#ACCUR
   0.00001
   the desired accuracy or relative error

#h
   0.1  
   the step size

#num loops
   1500
   the maximum number of loops allowed

#rel_p
   0.005
   the relaxation parameter
   
These boundary values should probably be placed in their own file, since
we will end up having many of them: 4 for each OP component
#bLeft
   1
   the left slip length

#bRight
   1
   the right slip length

#bTop
   1
   the top slip length

#bBott
   1
   the bottom slip length

#maxStore
   5
   the maximum number of previous vectors to be stored in the acceleration method

#wait
   2
   the number of iterations to wait before applying the acceleration
      it will be using normal relaxation until then
#betas
   1 -2 -2 -2 2
   all of the beta coefficients, 1-5, in order
#alpha
   -0.005
   the temperature-dependent alpha coefficient
#Ks
   1 1 1
   the K coefficients

Somehow, we need to be able to set all the
   boundary conditions based on values that
   we set in here.
