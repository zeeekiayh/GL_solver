This file contains the parameters for the solving method and the boundary
counditions. Each value must be directly after it's respective line that
begins with "#". All other text will be ignored.

#SIZE
   16 16      the length, or number of points in each direction
#ACCUR
   0.00001  the desired accuracy or relative error
#h
   0.1     the step size
#num loops
   1500     the maximum number of loops allowed
#rel_p
   0.005    the relaxation parameter

These boundary values should probably be placed in their own file, since
we will end up having many of them: 4 for each OP component
#bLeft
   1        the left slip length
#bRight
   1        the right slip length
#bTop
   1        the top slip length
#bBott
   1        the bottom slip length
#maxStore
   5        the maximum number of previous vectors to be stored in the acceleration method
#wait
   2        the number of iterations to wait before applying the acceleration
              it will be using normal relaxation until then
#betas
   1 -2 -2 -2 2
   all of the beta coefficients, 1-5, in order
#alpha
   -0.005
   the temperature-dependent alpha coefficient
#Ks
   1 1 1
   the K coefficients

Somehow, we need to be able to set all the
   boundary conditions based on values that
   we set in here.
