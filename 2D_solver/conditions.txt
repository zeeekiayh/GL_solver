This file contains the parameters for the solving method.
Each value must be directly after it's respective line that
begins with "#". All other text will be ignored.

#METHOD
   acceleration
   method can be "relaxation" or "acceleration"
#SIZE
   200 300
   the length, or number of points in each direction
#ACCUR
   1e-6
   the desired accuracy or relative error
#h
   0.05
   the step size
#num loops
   200
   the maximum number of loops allowed
#rel_p
   0.005
   the relaxation parameter
#maxStore
   7
   the maximum number of previous vectors to be stored in the acceleration method
#wait
   5
   the number of iterations to wait before applying the acceleration
      it will be using normal relaxation until then
#update
   1
   whether or not to use the no_update vector; 0 will use it, 1 will not
#betas
   1 -2 -2 -2 2
   all of the beta coefficients, 1-5, in order
#alpha
   -1
   the temperature-dependent alpha coefficient
#Ks
   1 1 1
   the K coefficients
