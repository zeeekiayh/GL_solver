# GL_solver

Using FEM to solve the GL equations.
I am open for any suggestions and help.

Ideas for presentation:
Should include:
    - What is the motivation for your research (why are you doing it)?
    - What is the background of your research, and what are competing approaches (if you know)? Keep in mind that most other students and faculty will have little knowledge of your research area, so you should give enough background for everyone to understand what you did.
    - What did you do that worked and what did you try that didn't work? For those who worked in labs: Don't forget pictures, since most of the audience may never have been in your lab.
    - What conclusions (if any) did you reach?

Brainstorming:
 - What did we want to accomplish?		We wanted to see if we could explain why the "polka-dot" phase appeared (in the experiment by Levitin et. al, 2019) when the stripped phase was predicted (by
 									Vorontsov and Sauls).
 - What did I do?						I solved the Ginsburg-Landau Equations for Helium-3
